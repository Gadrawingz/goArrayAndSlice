# Arrays

>In Go, an array is used to store multiple values of the same data type 
in a single variable. It can also be described as a numbered sequence 
of elements of a specific length.

>An array's length is part of its type, so arrays are of fixed size and 
> cannot be resized.

## 2 Ways to declare arrays
- Using **var** keyword
